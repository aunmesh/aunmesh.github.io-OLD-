**CVPR 2017**

My paper got accepted at CVPR 2017. I am the 2nd author in this paper -- arxiv 
[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04079.pdf). It is a work on 3D shape learning 
using Deep Learning. This is the beginning of a journey for me. 
I am motivated by this publication to study more and take up more 
projects in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
