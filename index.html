  <h2>Yearlong Objective</h2>
    <p>My year long objective for 2017-18 is to become more rooted in the Mathematics of Machine Learning and Computer Vision and try out a number of projects. I have also set out an algorithmic programming objective for 3 months in 2 languages, C++ and python. My aim is to fill in for what I have not been able to build in past 4 years, and then be able to confidently seek out opportunities around the world.</p>
